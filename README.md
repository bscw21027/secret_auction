# Secret Auction - Python Bidding System
Welcome to Secret Auction, a Python-based bidding system that allows users to participate in an anonymous auction. This program is developed to run on Python and provides a convenient way to conduct secret auctions, where participants can bid for items without revealing their identity to other bidders.

# Features
- **User Anonymity:** Secret Auction ensures complete anonymity of bidders, creating a fair and unbiased environment for all participants.
- **Bidding:** Participants can submit their bids for specific items, and the system will keep track of the highest bid for each item.
- **Auction Completion:** Once the auction ends, the system will announce the winner for each item along with the respective bid amount.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The program features a simple command-line interface, making it easy to navigate and participate in the auction.
 
# Usage

- Clone the GitHub repository:
  ```python
  python secret_auction.py
  ```

- The auctioneer should run the program and list the items available for bidding. Each item should have a unique identifier, a description, and a starting price.

- Participants can join the auction by running the program on their devices.

 - Bidders will be prompted to enter their bids for specific items by providing the item's identifier and their bid amount.

- Once the auction ends, the system will announce the winners for each item and display the respective bid amounts.
